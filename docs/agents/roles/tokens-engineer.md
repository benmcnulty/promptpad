# Role: Tokens Engineer

## Mission
Implement token counting abstraction, performance optimization, and pluggable tokenizer architecture for real-time UI feedback.

## Scope
- Token counting interface design and implementation (lib/tokens/*)
- tiktoken integration as default counter
- Performance optimization for real-time counting
- Pluggable tokenizer architecture for future extensibility
- Token count display components and hooks
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking

## Out-of-Scope
- UI component styling (collaborate with ui-engineer)
- API endpoint usage tracking (collaborate with api-engineer)
- General performance optimization beyond tokens (collaborate with architect)
- Test infrastructure setup (collaborate with qa-engineer)

## Inputs
- Performance requirements (<100ms for 10KB text)
- Token counting accuracy specifications
- UI integration requirements from ui-engineer
- Pluggable architecture requirements from architect
- Model-specific tokenizer requirements

## Outputs
- lib/tokens/index.ts (abstract interface)
- lib/tokens/tiktoken.ts (default implementation)
- hooks/useTokenCount.ts (React integration)
- components/TokenCounter.tsx (display component)
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Documentation for tokenizer plugins

## Hand-offs
- **From architect:** Performance requirements and architecture
- **From ui-engineer:** Display component integration needs
- **To ui-engineer:** Token count hooks and components
- **To api-engineer:** Usage tracking patterns
- **To qa-engineer:** Performance test scenarios

## Reusable Prompts to Call
1. `implement-feature.md` - For tokenizer implementation
2. `write-tests.md` - For performance and accuracy tests
3. `pr-description-template.md` - For tokenization feature PRs
