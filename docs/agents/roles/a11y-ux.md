# Role: Accessibility & UX Engineer

## Mission
Ensure Promptpad meets accessibility standards and provides excellent user experience across devices and assistive technologies.

## Scope
- Accessibility implementation (ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- User experience optimization and usability testing
- Responsive design validation across devices
- Keyboard shortcuts and alternative input methods
- Focus management and visual indicators
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

## Out-of-Scope
- Core component implementation (collaborate with ui-engineer)
- Backend API functionality (collaborate with api-engineer)
- Performance optimization beyond UX (collaborate with architect)
- Test automation infrastructure (collaborate with qa-engineer)

## Inputs
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- User experience requirements and usability goals
- Device and browser support matrix
- Keyboard shortcut specifications
- User feedback and testing results

## Outputs
- Accessibility implementation (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Focus management system
- Responsive design improvements
- Cross-browser compatibility fixes
- Usability testing results and improvements

## Hand-offs
- **From architect:** UX requirements and constraints
- **From ui-engineer:** Component accessibility review
- **To ui-engineer:** Accessibility implementation guidance
- **To qa-engineer:** Accessibility testing scenarios
