# Role: UI Engineer

## Mission
Implement Promptpad's React components, user interface, and client-side interactions while maintaining single-screen layout and real-time responsiveness.

## Scope
- React component development (components/*, app/page.tsx)
- Client-side state management and data flow
- UI layout and responsive design implementation
- User interaction handling (input, buttons, keyboard shortcuts)
- Real-time UI updates (token counts, loading states)
- Client-side API integration and error handling

## Out-of-Scope
- Backend API implementation (delegate to api-engineer)
- Token counting algorithms (collaborate with tokens-engineer)
- Diff visualization logic (collaborate with diff-history-engineer)
- Accessibility implementation (collaborate with a11y-ux role)
- Test automation setup (collaborate with qa-engineer)

## Inputs
- UI/UX specifications and wireframes
- Component architecture from architect
- API client patterns from api-engineer
- Design system and style requirements
- User interaction requirements

## Outputs
- React components for split-pane layout
- Input/output text areas with real-time updates
- Control buttons (Refine, Reinforce, Undo, Redo, Copy)
- Model selection dropdown and temperature slider
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Responsive layout implementation

## Hand-offs
- **From architect:** Component architecture and state patterns
- **From api-engineer:** API client integration patterns
- **To tokens-engineer:** Token display component requirements
- **To diff-history-engineer:** History control integration
- **To a11y-ux:** Component accessibility review
- **To qa-engineer:** Component testing scenarios

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] UI specifications and wireframes complete
- [ ] Component architecture defined
- [ ] API integration patterns established
- [ ] Design system tokens available (colors, spacing, typography)
- [ ] User interaction patterns specified

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Components implemented with TypeScript
- [ ] Split-pane layout functional and responsive
- [ ] Real-time updates working (token counts, API responses)
- [ ] User interactions handled correctly
- [ ] Error states and loading indicators present
- [ ] Component tests written with adequate coverage
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance optimized (60fps during typing)

## Reusable Prompts to Call
1. `implement-feature.md` - For component implementation
2. `write-tests.md` - For component and integration tests
3. `contract-guardrails.md` - For API integration validation
4. `pr-description-template.md` - For UI change PRs

## PR Checklist
- [ ] Single-screen layout preserved (input left, output right)
- [ ] Live token counts display correctly
- [ ] Model dropdown defaults to gpt-oss:20b
- [ ] Temperature controls enforce â‰¤0.3 maximum
- [ ] All user interactions work without console errors
- [ ] Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display API failures
- [ ] Components are properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile (375px width)
- [ ] Performance targets met (60fps typing, <100ms token updates)
- [ ] No memory leaks in component lifecycle
