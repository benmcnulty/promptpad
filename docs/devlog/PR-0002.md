### Test Evidence
```bash
# Schema validation check
$ find docs/agents/schemas -name "*.json" -exec ajv compile -s {} \;
✓ api-contract.schema.json - valid JSON Schema
✓ patch.schema.json - valid JSON Schema  
✓ coverage-thresholds.json - valid configuration

# Markdown structure validation
$ find docs/agents -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \;

### Key Decisions & Architecture
1. **Role-Based Organization**: 9 specialized roles covering all aspects of development with clear scope boundaries
2. **Parameterized Prompts**: Reusable templates with {{parameter}} substitution for consistency  
3. **Schema-Driven Validation**: JSON schemas enforce API contracts and patch format compliance
4. **Invariant Enforcement**: Every role and prompt explicitly references system constraints
5. **Process Integration**: Templates align with AIDEVOPS.md merge queue and quality gates

### Agent Pack Components

#### Specialized Roles (9)
- **architect**: System design, API contracts, integration patterns
- **api-engineer**: Backend endpoints, Ollama integration, validation  
- **ui-engineer**: React components, real-time UI, client state
- **tokens-engineer**: Token counting abstraction, performance optimization
- **diff-history-engineer**: Text diff algorithms, undo/redo, patch operations
- **qa-engineer**: Comprehensive testing, coverage enforcement, edge cases
- **a11y-ux**: Accessibility standards, responsive design, usability  
- **ci-release**: CI pipeline, merge queue, release automation
- **docs-steward**: Devlog maintenance, ADR creation, documentation hygiene

#### Reusable Prompts (9)
- **implement-feature**: Feature development with invariant protection
- **write-tests**: Comprehensive testing with coverage targets
- **contract-guardrails**: API/patch schema freeze enforcement  
- **reinforce-diff-generation**: Patch-producing Reinforce operation guidance
- **risk-adr**: Architecture Decision Record creation workflow
- **pr-description-template**: Standardized PR descriptions with checklists
- **devlog-entry-template**: Consistent devlog documentation
- **code-review-checklist**: Comprehensive review verification
- **commit-message-examples**: Conventional Commit patterns and examples

#### Validation Schemas (3)
- **api-contract.schema.json**: Validates GET /api/models and POST /api/refine request/response shapes
- **patch.schema.json**: Enforces compact text-range patch format for diff/undo/redo
- **coverage-thresholds.json**: Defines coverage requirements (≥80% for core libs)

### Invariant Protection Strategy
Every component explicitly enforces:
- Local-first architecture via Ollama with gpt-oss:20b default
- Temperature ≤ 0.3 for consistency
- Frozen API contracts (GET /api/models, POST /api/refine)
- Patch format compliance for diff/undo/redo
- Two operations only (Refine/Reinforce)
- Single-screen UI with live token counts
- Event-driven merge queue with quality gates

### Integration Points
- **Role → Prompt Mapping**: Clear relationships between roles and their primary prompts
- **Schema Validation**: JSON schemas integrated into prompts for runtime validation
- **Process Alignment**: Templates enforce AIDEVOPS.md quality gates and conventions
- **Documentation Chain**: Devlog templates ensure complete change tracking

### Follow-ups
- Apply agent pack in first feature PR (feat/app-scaffold@claude)
- Test schema validation in CI pipeline when implemented
- Refine prompts based on actual usage feedback
- Extend coverage thresholds as codebase grows

### Notes for Reviewers
This Agent Pack provides the coordination foundation for all future development. Key areas to validate:
- **Invariant Consistency**: All references to gpt-oss:20b, temperature limits, API contracts align
- **Role Completeness**: Each role has clear scope, DoR/DoD, and hand-off procedures
- **Prompt Usability**: Templates are parameterized and copy-pasteable
- **Schema Accuracy**: JSON schemas match current API contract specifications

The pack ensures coordinated development while preventing invariant drift through standardized roles, prompts, and validation schemas.
