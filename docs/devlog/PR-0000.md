## <PR #TBD> docs: align agent guidance with AIDEVOPS
- Branch: docs/aidevops-alignment@codex
- Author/Agent: codex
- Scope: docs
- Summary: Align AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and Copilot instructions with AIDEVOPS; enforce event-driven merge queue; default gpt-oss:20b; freeze API contract and patch shape.
- Touched Areas: [AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md, CHANGELOG.md]
- Test Evidence:
  - Repository currently contains documentation only; no Node project scaffold present.
  - Commands planned when app scaffolds exist:
    - pnpm typecheck | pnpm lint | pnpm build | pnpm test -- --coverage
  - Evidence will be attached in subsequent PRs once code/test harness is present.
- Risks & Mitigations:
  - Risk: Guidance drift across agents → Mitigation: single source of truth in AIDEVOPS; explicit PR checklist.
  - Risk: API/patch drift → Mitigation: ADR required for any contract change.
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider adding CI, CODEOWNERS, and PR template per AIDEVOPS Section 10.
