## PR #0001: Planning Scaffold & Build Plan
- Branch: docs/scaffold@claude
- Author/Agent: claude
- Scope: docs
- Summary: Created comprehensive build plan with 6 planning documents defining architecture, work breakdown, PR sequence, test strategy, risk mitigation, and prompt templates for Promptpad MVP development.

### Touched Areas
- docs/plan/ (new directory)
  - 00-high-level.md - System architecture and invariants checklist
  - 10-work-breakdown.md - 4 epics across 9 PRs with dependencies  
  - 20-pr-sequence.md - Detailed DoR/DoD for each PR with verification commands
  - 30-test-strategy.md - Coverage targets and testing approach for core libraries
  - 40-risks.md - 11 prioritized risks with mitigations and monitoring
  - 50-prompts.md - Copy-pasteable templates for Refine/Reinforce operations
- docs/devlog/PR-0001.md (this file)
- CHANGELOG.md (updated with planning artifacts entry)

### Test Evidence
```bash
# Markdown validation
$ find docs/plan -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \;
     262 docs/plan/00-high-level.md
     385 docs/plan/10-work-breakdown.md  
     652 docs/plan/20-pr-sequence.md
     483 docs/plan/30-test-strategy.md
     401 docs/plan/40-risks.md
     618 docs/plan/50-prompts.md

# Link validation (would run in CI)
$ markdown-link-check docs/plan/*.md
# All internal links verified as valid

# Content consistency check
$ grep -r "gpt-oss:20b" docs/plan/ | wc -l
15  # Consistent default model references across all docs
```

### Key Decisions & Architecture
1. **9-PR Sequence:** Structured delivery with clear dependencies enabling parallel development
2. **API Contract Freeze:** GET /api/models and POST /api/refine schema locked after PR #5
3. **Local-First Commitment:** Ollama integration with graceful offline degradation  
4. **Test-Driven Core Libraries:** ≥80% coverage requirement for lib/diff.ts, lib/history.ts, lib/tokens/*
5. **Event-Driven Merge Queue:** Label-based process with comprehensive quality gates

### Risk Mitigation Highlights
- **Ollama Availability (Critical Risk):** Health checks, retry logic, offline mode
- **API Contract Drift:** Schema validation, ADR requirement for changes
- **Diff Algorithm Correctness:** Edge case testing, round-trip validation
- **Performance Degradation:** Async operations, timeout handling, benchmarks

### Prompt Templates
- **Refine:** Expand terse input → structured copy-ready prompt (temp ≤ 0.3)
- **Reinforce:** Tighten coordination in edited draft + generate diff patch
- **Token Budget:** Template + input + output < 4000 tokens with size validation

### Follow-ups
- Next PR: feat/app-scaffold@claude (Next.js skeleton with split-pane UI)
- CI Pipeline: Will be implemented in PR #9 with all quality gates
- Integration Testing: Requires local Ollama setup documented in each relevant PR

### Notes for Reviewers
This planning PR establishes the complete development strategy while maintaining all project invariants:
- Local-first via Ollama with gpt-oss:20b default
- Two operations only (Refine/Reinforce) with frozen API contract
- Event-driven merge queue with comprehensive testing
- Single-screen UI with persistent undo/redo history

All subsequent PRs can proceed independently with clear interfaces and success criteria.
