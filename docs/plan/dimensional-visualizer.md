# Dimensional Visualizer: Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Dimensional Visualizer is a modular, scalable 3D visualization interface for Promptpad, designed to render LLM output as a series of connected vectors in a dynamic, animated three-dimensional space. The initial use case is to visualize LLM responses, but the architecture must support future visualization experiments and feature expansion. This plan provides a detailed, task-oriented breakdown for incremental agent-driven development, ensuring maintainability, extensibility, and a visually rich user experience.

## 1. Architecture & Component Structure

### 1.1. Core Principles
- **Component Modularity:** All visualization, animation, and effect logic should be encapsulated in reusable, composable React components.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Data fetching, transformation, rendering, and UI controls should be clearly separated.
- **Scalability:** The system must support additional visualization modes and experiments with minimal refactoring.
- **Customization:** Color schemes, animation parameters, and effects should be easily configurable and extensible.

### 1.2. High-Level Component Tree
- `DimensionalVisualizerPage`
  - `LLMChatBox` (existing or shared)
  - `Visualizer3DContainer`
    - `VectorScene` (ThreeJS/React Three Fiber canvas)
      - `VectorPath` (renders connected vectors)
      - `VectorPoint` (individual points/nodes)
      - `AnimatedEffects` (particle systems, glows, trails, etc.)
      - `CameraControls` (orbit, zoom, pan)
      - `ThemeProvider` (color/lighting context)
    - `VisualizationControls` (UI for color, animation, effect toggles)
  - `VisualizationStatusBar` (current mode, stats, etc.)

## 2. Data Flow & API Integration

### 2.1. LLM Output Pipeline
- User submits input via chatbox.
- LLM API returns output (vectorizable text or data).
- Output is transformed into a vector representation (embedding, token mapping, or custom logic).
- Vector data is passed to the 3D visualizer for rendering.

### 2.2. Extensibility
- Abstract the vectorization logic to allow for different LLMs or data sources.
- Support for multiple vectorization strategies (e.g., embeddings, token positions, semantic clusters).

---

## 3. Visualization & Animation Features

### 3.1. Core 3D Visualization
- Render a set of connected vectors in 3D space using React Three Fiber.
- Support for dynamic camera movement and user interaction (orbit, zoom, pan).
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.

### 3.2. Customization & Effects
- **Color Themes:** Dynamic, user-selectable color palettes (gradient, neon, dark, etc.).
- **Animated Effects:**
  - Particle trails following vector paths
  - Pulsing/glowing vector points
  - Animated transitions between states
  - Customizable animation speed and intensity
- **Lighting & Materials:**
  - Ambient, directional, and point lights
  - Material presets (glass, metal, matte, etc.)
- **Backgrounds:**
  - Gradient, starfield, or void backgrounds
  - Optional animated backgrounds

### 3.3. UI Controls
- Toggle and adjust visualization parameters (color, animation, effects)
- Switch between visualization modes (e.g., path, cluster, network)
- Export/share visualization (image, video, data)

## 4. Task Breakdown for Agents

### 4.1. Initial Setup
- [ ] Integrate React Three Fiber and supporting libraries (e.g., drei, leva for controls)
- [ ] Scaffold `Visualizer3DContainer` and `VectorScene` components
- [ ] Establish data flow from LLM API to vectorization to 3D scene

### 4.2. Core Visualization
- [ ] Implement basic 3D vector rendering (lines and points)
- [ ] Add camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan)
- [ ] Connect chatbox input/output to visualization updates

### 4.3. Customization & Effects
- [ ] Add color theme context and dynamic palette switching
- [ ] Implement animated effects (pulsing, trails, glows)
- [ ] Add lighting and material presets
- [ ] Support background customization

### 4.4. UI & Controls
- [ ] Build `VisualizationControls` for user customization
- [ ] Add `VisualizationStatusBar` for mode/status display
- [ ] Implement export/share functionality (optional, stretch)

### 4.5. Extensibility & Experimentation
- [ ] Abstract vectorization logic for pluggable strategies
- [ ] Scaffold for additional visualization modes (network, cluster, etc.)
- [ ] Document extension points and usage patterns

### 4.6. Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Document all components, props, and extension points
- [ ] Add usage examples and architecture diagrams
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for core components

## 5. Collaboration & Handoff Guidance
- Each task above should be implemented as a focused PR with clear scope and in-code documentation.
- All new components must include JSDoc/type annotations and usage comments.
- Update this plan and in-repo documentation as new features or requirements emerge.
- Use the `docs/devlog/` directory to log major milestones and design decisions.

## 7. Appendix: Example Extension Points
- **Custom Vectorization:** Implement new strategies in `lib/vectorization.ts` and inject via props/context.
- **New Effects:** Add new effect components under `components/visualizer/effects/` and register in the main scene.
- **Visualization Modes:** Scaffold new modes as subcomponents and expose via mode switcher in controls.
