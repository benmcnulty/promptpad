# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Promptpad is a **fully functional** local-first prompt drafting tool built with Next.js 15.4.6 + TypeScript. It expands terse instructions into copy-ready prompts via Ollama (default: `gpt-oss:20b`). The app implements a two-pass workflow: Refine (expand) and Reinforce (tighten edited drafts) with comprehensive UI/UX enhancements.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Fully implemented with comprehensive testing, responsive design, loading animations, debugging tools, and optimized prompting.

## Invariants & Boundaries
- Local‚Äëfirst via Ollama; default `gpt-oss:20b`; temperature ~0.2 (‚â§0.3 unless justified).
- Ollama timeout: 120 seconds (increased from 30s to support large models like gpt-oss:20b).
- Only two operations: Refine and Reinforce. Keep endpoints stable.
- Endpoints: `GET /api/models`, `GET /api/git-info`, `POST /api/refine` with `mode: refine|reinforce` ‚Üí `{ output, usage, patch?, systemPrompt?, fallbackUsed? }`.
- Patch format: compact text‚Äërange ops used by diff/undo/redo. Do not change without an ADR.
- All model responses are automatically cleaned of unwanted prefixes (e.g., "**Prompt:**", "Here's the refined prompt:").

## Contracts (Frozen)
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/models` ‚Üí `{ models: Array<OllamaModel> }`  
  - `GET /api/git-info` ‚Üí `{ sha: string, branch: string, timestamp: string }`
  - `POST /api/refine` body `{ mode: "refine" | "reinforce", input?, draft?, model, temperature }` ‚Üí `{ output, usage, patch?, systemPrompt?, fallbackUsed? }`

- Canonical API response example:
```json
{
  "output": "Write a 500-word blog post about sustainable gardening practices...",
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 42, "output_tokens": 187 },
  "patch": [
    { "op": "replace", "from": [0, 58], "to": "improved text here" }
  ],
  "systemPrompt": "You are Promptpad, a prompt-drafting assistant...",
  "fallbackUsed": false
}
```
- Schemas: `docs/agents/schemas/api-contract.schema.json`, `docs/agents/schemas/patch.schema.json`
- Any change requires an ADR before implementation.

## Coding Rules
- Keep API handlers thin; move logic into small, pure functions in `lib/`.
- Favor single‚Äëresponsibility diffs; avoid drive‚Äëby refactors.
- Add/maintain tests before changing `lib/diff.ts`, `lib/history.ts`, or `lib/tokens/*`.
- Provide CLI‚Äëstyle commands in PRs for verification (typecheck, lint, build, test).

## Test Scaffold (add or update first)
- `lib/diff.ts`: patch generation and application round‚Äëtrips; edge cases (CRLF, unicode, empty ranges).
- `lib/history.ts`: push/undo/redo, snapshot persistence, hydration from `localStorage`.
- `lib/tokens/*`: counting is stable for common inputs; performance won‚Äôt block UI.
- API: `/api/refine` returns `{ output, usage, patch? }` respecting `mode`; validates `model` via `/api/models`.

Suggested commands (paste outputs in PR):
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm test -- --coverage`

## Development Commands

When source code is implemented, use these commands:
- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies  
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
- `pnpm typecheck` - Run TypeScript checks
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint + Prettier
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm test -- --coverage` - Run tests with coverage

## Two‚ÄëPass Workflow & Prompts

### Refine Operation
**Purpose**: Expand terse input into detailed, actionable prompts
**System Prompt**: Comprehensive instructions to transform vague requests into specific, measurable requirements with relevant constraints (word count, format, tone, etc.)
**Features**: Auto-cleanup of unwanted AI technical parameters, direct prompt content output

### Reinforce Operation  
**Purpose**: Optimize existing prompts for precision and effectiveness
**System Prompt**: Focused on sharpening language, adding missing constraints, reorganizing for clarity, and removing redundancy
**Features**: No meta-commentary, significant content improvements, maintains original intent

## Process & Merge Queue
- Use Conventional Commits; focused branches `feat/|fix/|docs/|chore/|refactor/|spike/` with optional `@claude`.
- Append a devlog file `docs/devlog/PR-<number>.md` with commands and outputs.
- If invariants or API would change, open an ADR and link it; do not merge without acceptance.
- Mark PR `queue:ready` only when typecheck, lint, build, tests are green and checklist is complete.

## Examples
- Commit: `feat(refine): show token counts beside editors`
- Commit: `fix(reinforce): correct patch ranges on CRLF files`
- PR includes: checklist, devlog link, screenshots (if UI), and confirmation of no API/patch drift.
